Together we are going to develop a detail parser specification in two phases for an idea I have, stated below.

Phase 1: Brainstorming
Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to generate a detailed specification I can hand off to a developer. Let’s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Phase 2: Generate Detail Specification
After you have asked all the questions you want, compile all findings into a efficiently-worded, comprehensive, developer-ready specification. Include all relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin implementation.

Idea: I have attached the following files:

`parser-interface.md` - explains the parser functional interface
`hints.txt` - this will be hints for a specific parser
`parser-spec.md` - the spec we will develop

I want to be able to give a developer those files along with some sample emails in JSON format so a developer can create a new parser. I have also included the following files for you to be able to see what existing parsers look like.

`email_data.py` - common email/joke data types
`parser_best_of_humor.py` - parser
`parser_christian_voices.py` - parser
`parser_sanderson.py` - parser
`parser_you_make_me_laugh.py` - parser
