Here's a great clean joke for the collection:

Title: The Tech Support Call

A man called tech support and said, "My computer says 'keyboard not found.' What should I do?"

The support technician replied, "Press F1 to continue."

The man paused for a moment, then asked, "How can I press F1 if my keyboard isn't found?"

Best regards,
John
