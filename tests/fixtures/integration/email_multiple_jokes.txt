Hi team, here are three short jokes:

---

Title: Parallel Lines

I have a joke about parallel lines.

Too bad they'll never meet.

Title: Chemists

Two chemists walk into a bar. The first one says, "I'll have H2O."

The second one says, "I'll have H2O too."

The second chemist died.

Title: Debugging

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

Because light attracts bugs!

Enjoy!
